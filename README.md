# UC Berkeley iSchool MIDS Program 

# w205 Fundamentals of Data Engineering

For the new students, welcome to Berkeley, welcome to the iSchool, and welcome to the MIDS program!

For all students, welcome to w205! 

Our goal is to help you be extremely successful in this course, and this repo has a lot of resources to help you achieve that goal.

## Slack

Our primary means of communication is done using slack.  

Please join the channel **datasci-205** if you have not done so already.  Please use this channel to post any technical questions.  All instructors and TAs monitor this channel, so you chances of receiving an answer are greater if you post here.  Also, often, other students can help answer questions as well.  If one student has an issue or question, chances are other students will have the same issue or question.  So, other students can benefit from your questions, and likewise, you can benefit from theirs.

Most instructors prefer a slack direct message to an email. Please check with your instructor as to their preference.

## Office Hours

Office hours will be posted to the learning management system.   

Instructors have the option to participate in pooled office hours where students from other sections can attend their office hours.  If your section has been included in another instructor's office hours, you are allowed to attend.

TA office hours will be pooled.  All sections can attend TA office hours.

## Attendance and Participation

Attendance and participation are 5% of your semester grade.

Attendance and participation are self reported under the UC Berkeley Honor Code using a Google Form

**Spring 2021 Form (must be logged into Berkeley account):**  TBD

Attendance Rubrics:
* Graded 1 to 100
* First 2 absences are automatically counted as excused
* After 2 absences, instructor will determine if absence is excused or not
* Excused absences that are made up, no points deducted
* Unexcused absences that are made up, -5 point penalty
* Excused or unexcused absences that are not made up, -10 points penalty
* Official Berkeley holidays are excused absences and do not have to be made up

Classes can be made up by:
* Watching a video recording of a class meeting and working through the breakouts on your own
* By attending another section (with instructor approval)

Participation Rubrics:
* Come to class on time
* Stay until the instructor dismisses class (or if it runs over, until the official end of class time)
* Camera on at least 90% of class time (81 minutes out of 90 minutes)
* Microphone on mute unless you are speaking (except for breakout rooms where it is fine to keep the microphone on)
* Actively participate in breakout rooms
* Speak at least one during whole class discussions
* Not monopolize more than your fair share of class time - give others a chance to speak, to express their ideas and opinions, and to ask questions
* Be respectul of your fellow students and instructor
* Each item missing for an attended class, -1 to a max of -3 per class

## Asynch Assessments

Asynch assessments are 5% of your semester grade. 

In the asynch, after each logical topic or concept, an assessment is given.  They are multiple choice, and you get as many tries to answer each question until you get it right.  If you answer a question wrong, it will give you feedback as to why it's wrong, and allow you to answer it again.  So, as long as you complete the assessment, you should get 100%.

Each week's asynch assessments are due prior to that week's class start time.  (Except for week 1, since it's the first week, the due date is relaxed to allow an extra week)

## Projects

* Project 1 will be an individual project in which you will analyze a dataset stored in a relational database using Python and SQL, and also provide data visualizations, and executive summaries backed up by data to answer questions from executives.
  * Individual 
  * 29% of your semester grade is the project itself
  * 1% of your semester grade is reading and acknowledging the feedback you received
* Project 2 will be an individual project focused on data wrangling. You will design and implement a data pipeline to take a nested JSON file, extract it, load it, cleansing it, etc. and prepare executive summaries for executives on your data pipeline.
  * Individual
  * 29% of your semester grade is the project itself
  * 1% of your semester grade is reading and acknowledging the feedback you received
* Project 3 is a group project and has two parts:
  * Group
  * 15% of your semester grade is the coding part - you will design and code a NoSQL graph database.
  * 15% of your semester grade is the presentation part - you will design a high level, comprehensive data engineering solution and present it in the last class meeting, using all the different technologies you have learned about this semester.  No coding is required for this part - it's high level design only.

## Readings

Right now, we have not been able to find suitable readings for this course.  The challenge is that most reading for topics included in this course are at an undergraduate upper division computer science level.  They assume students are well versed in all the computer science terminology and theory. Most academic papers assume graduate level computer science knowledge and are highly theoretical.

We have tried using O'Reilly technical books, but have faced some issues there as well.  The Berkeley library only subscribes to the lowest level of O'Reilly and most of the readings would be from books that are behind a paywall.  Since we cover 10 or more different technologies, it would result in students buying 10 books at $40 to $60 each.  Also, it's not practical to have students read 10 or more technical books in a 14 week period.  We have tried pulling relevant chapters out, but it's really hard to understand a chapter pulled out of book as they will often refer to knowledge presented in earlier chapters.  

We are currently exploring industry white papers to see if there are any suitable papers there.
